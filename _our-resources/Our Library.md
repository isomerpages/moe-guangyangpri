The more that you learn, the more places you’ll go.” It has also been said that reading opens one’s mind to endless possibilities. However, the love for reading is one that only few children are engaged in at a very young age.<br><br>In view of this, the TVPS library constantly strives to create a positive and conducive learning environment for all pupils to develop their love for reading. The library carefully procures and stocks quality books annually and displays them at a prominent place in the library for easy access to pupils. Older books are replaced with newer ones. To further fuel the pupils’ passion for reading, iREAD books are conveniently placed in every classroom and rotated among the classes for pupils to read in class during their pockets of free time.<br><br>To allow pupils more time to borrow books, pupils are also immersed into the world of books&nbsp; during visits to the library during their weekly library period. Teachers also harness this period to teach and advise pupils on how to select level-appropriate books.<br><br>To encourage more pupils to read, Top Readers Awards are given to pupils. The Top readers from each class will be awarded with collar pins and the Top Readers of the level were given a book prize. The book reviews written by the Top Readers were displayed in the library.</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Our Resources/Library/NK5_6410.JPG"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Our Resources/Library/NK5_6409.JPG"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Our Resources/Library/NK5_6407.JPG"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>

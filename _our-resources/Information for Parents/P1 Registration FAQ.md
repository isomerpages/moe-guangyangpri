P1 Registration Exercise 2021 (for admission to P1 in 2022)
-----------------------------------------------------------

The 2021 P1 Registration Exercise will be conducted from June toÂ October 2021 for children born between 2 January 2015 and 1 January 2016 (both dates inclusive).

In view of the merger between Guangyang Primary School and Townsville Primary School in January 2023, both schools will still be conducting the 2021 Primary One registration exercise at the respective schools for Phase 1 to Phase 2(A)2. Thereafter, registration in Phase 2B to Phase 2C Supplementary will be conducted at Townsville Primary School.

Children who are successfully registered in these schools will report to the eventual merged school site at Townsville Primary School in January 2022.

Parents should refer to the registration phases and procedures to find out which phase their children are eligible for, the dates for registration, how to register and the documents required for registration.

<h4>P4 Sports Education Programme (SEP) â€“ Inline Skating</h4>
<p>As part of the P4 post-exam activities, our students were treated to inline
skating programme, where the students get to learn how to inline skate
with their friends. The energy in the hall was electric as students glide
around the hall during the two-hour program, filled with laughter and cheers,
creating unforgettable memories together.</p>

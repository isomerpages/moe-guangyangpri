Our school has achieved the “SG Clean” quality mark for all General, Eating Areas and Food Stalls from The National Environment Agency’s (NEA) “SG Clean” campaign.

The National Environment Agency launched the “SG Clean” campaign on 16 Feb 2020 to promote the adoption of good personal and environmental hygiene practices, as part of the response to COVID-19. The campaign targets premises that are often visited by large numbers of people (e.g. transport nodes, schools, hawker centers, hotels, etc.), and involves stakeholders committing to adhering to a sanitation and hygiene checklist. Premises which comply will be awarded the “SG Clean” quality mark.

This achievement would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication from our operations officers, contract staff and our diligent students.

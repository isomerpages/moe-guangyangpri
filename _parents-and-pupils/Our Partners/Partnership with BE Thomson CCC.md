In line with our strategic thrust to forge collaborative partnership with parents and the community at large, the school named Bishan East – Thomson CCC (BE-Thomson CCC) and MDAS as our external partners. 

GYPS Seniors – Students Interaction Group aims to help engage the senior citizens from Bishan in healthy activities. They are engaged in light exercise (Ba Duan Jin) as well as interactions amongst themselves and with pupils from GYPS. It is through such interaction that the school hopes to develop in pupils a sense of moral responsibility, love, care and concern towards others in the community. Friendship is fostered between the young and old through communication and interaction. At the same time, pupils develop the important skill of listening and cultivate a strong desire to make a positive difference in the lives of others.

In partnership with BE-Thomson CCC, GYPS organised the following:

#### 1\. Seniors – Students Interaction on Tuesdays

Primary 3 to Primary 6 classes are scheduled for the interaction/exercise session with the senior citizens. Pupils will interact with the senior citizens for half an hour and join the senior citizens in their exercise session for the next half an hour.

Form teachers will follow up by having discussions with the pupils based on the interactions. They Pupils would then submit their reflections.

#### 2\. Seniors – Students Interaction Group Chinese New Celebrations

Chinese New Year Celebrations 2020 with our Senior Citizens of Bishan East Thomson CCC

Once again, Guangyang Primary School goes out to show that we are a ‘Vibrant School’ by hosting the Chinese New Year Celebrations with our senior citizens. Each year, our Primary six students take on an active role in serving the community. Their involvement, together with our teachers and non-teaching staff show that our culture of ‘All hands on deck’ is one that is put into action.

For 2020 our CNY celebrations with our senior citizens took place on 4 February and we had about 50 senior citizens joining us. Our P6 students, sat and conversed with them, served them breakfast and performed for them. It was all praises as the Guangyang family went out of the way to make our guests comfortable, feel valued and appreciated.

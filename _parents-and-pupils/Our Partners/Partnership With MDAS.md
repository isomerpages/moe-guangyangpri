#### Muscular Dystrophy Association of Singapore (MDAS)

GYPS believes in collaborating with the community and teaching the pupils the importance of giving back to society.  For this intent and purpose, the school adopted the Muscular Dystrophy Association of Singapore (MDAS).

MDAS is one of our community partners. It is a voluntary welfare organization that provides care and support to people with muscular dystrophy. It aims to maximise the quality of life of people with muscular dystrophy and their families as well as integrate them into the society.

MDAS works closely with GYPS in providing Values In Action opportunities for pupils and staff.

Values in Action (VIA) are learning experiences that support pupils’ development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community. As part of VIA, pupils reflect on their experiences, the values they have put into practice, and how they can continue to contribute meaningfully.

#### 1\. Awareness Talk by MDAS during Assembly

Every year MDAS gives an awareness talk on muscular dystrophy. This year, MDAS addressed our pupils on 11 March 2019. The talk was well-received by the pupils. Our pupils learned about the challenges and success stories of the MDAS members. The Primary 5 pupils then embarked on a project work to spread awareness amongst the rest of the pupils. They worked on a project for a week and presented their work to the teachers and classmates.

#### 2\. VIA by Prefects: MDAS Flag Day 2019

As part of their VIA, our enthusiastic prefects raised funds for MDAS in school during recess. The Prefects used their knowledge that they gathered from their project work and went on to educate the rest of the pupils. They particularly shared the needs of MDAS members. This was effective as pupils learnt how the funds would help the MDAS members. The Visual Art Club members also created innovative advertisement boards that the prefects used. The Prefects reflected on their experiences after the fundraising and it was indeed a fruitful experience.

#### 6\. A Cup From the heart

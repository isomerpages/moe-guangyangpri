<p><strong><u>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it compulsory to attend the CCAs?</strong>
</p>
<p>CCA is not compulsory in primary schools. However, your Primary 3 to Primary
6 child is highly encouraged to join a CCA as our school’s CCA programme
provides your child / ward with the platform to discover their interests
and talents. These platforms can fuel your child’s love for a particular
activity, be it a sport, a musical pursuit or a skill. Each CCA has its
specific objectives, e.g. physical sports develop resilience, fair play
and team spirit in students, visual and performing arts help students to
appreciate the rich culture and arts, clubs help students to explore their
interests. CCAs are also good platforms for students to build lasting friendships
with their peers.</p>

<p>Students will begin CCA in Primary 3 onwards. A consent form will be issued
through Parents Gateway (PG) before the commencement of CCA.</p>

</p>
<p>Students who are new to the school will be assigned a Student Learning
Space (SLS) CCA package to understand the different CCAs offered in the
school. After which, they can sign up for a CCA via our sign-up form available
on the FormSg platform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do I know if my child’s CCA application gets through?</strong>
</p>

of registration. You will receive consent via Parents Gateway (PG) before

CCA.</p>

<p><strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How will the choices be allocated?</strong>
</p>
<p>CCAs are allocated based on students’ choices and CCA availability. Rank
of student choice is important as it helps with the allocation of the CCA.
Students will be allocated to the CCAs within the choices wherever possible.
If there are no available vacancies within the CCA selected by the student,
students may be approached to re-consider their CCA choices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can my child change his/her CCA?</strong>
</p>
<p>Students are encouraged to stay on their CCA as it takes time to build
skills acquisition as well as relationship formation among students. As
such, students are required to stay in the CCA for at least 1 year before
considering a change of CCA. Once a change is affected, students are not
allowed to make another CCA change to allow students to fully benefit from
the CCA experience, Should a change if CCA be required due to exceptional
circumstances, please refer to the school CCA’s policy.</p>

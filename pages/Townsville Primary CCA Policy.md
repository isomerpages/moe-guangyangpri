<h4><strong><u>Townsville Co-Curricular Activities Policy</u></strong></h4>
<p>Our school is guided by a CCA Policy in operationalising our CCA so that
the desired learning outcomes are realised. Our CCA Policy is as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CCA is
an integral part of holistic development. All Primary 3 to Primary 6 students
are strongly encouraged to take up a CCA and <strong><u>commit to it for at least a year</u></strong>.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All members
must attend their CCA regularly. A minimum of 70% attendance per term is
required, or their place in the CCA may be forfeited.</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All Primary
6 students are expected to continue with their CCA until the end of May.
They are not allowed to take up a new CCA unless special permission is
given.</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students
who wish to change CCA must submit a request through the CCA teachers to
the HOD/PAM &amp; CCA for approval.&nbsp; <strong>A change of CCA is only allowed <u>during Term 4 Week 4 to Week 6 of the academic year</u> after at least committing to 1 year in the CCA.</strong>
</p>
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students
who wish to withdraw from their CCA due to a valid reason, must first inform
and seek permission from the CCA Teacher (Overall-In-Charge) before submitting
“Withdrawal/Change of Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) Application Form” online.</p>

<p>I am Adway Lakshmi Narayanan and I am the President of the Student Leaders’ Council of Townsville Primary School for 2023.</p><p>After completing 6 years of my primary school education in Townsville Primary, I feel ready for the real world and that I can overcome any challenge with sheer hard work and consistent effort.</p><p>I still remember the day of the Student Leaders’ Council Investiture when I had to deliver a speech to the school. It was nerve-wracking as I had never spoken to the school in such a capacity. I will never forget that day as I accepted the responsibilities of being the role model of the school.</p><p>As a student in Townsville, one can expect many opportunities to nurture their talents. I began developing my speaking skills during Show and Tell sessions in Primary 1 and 2. In Primary 3 and 4, I begin to develop my leadership potential when I was selected to be a junior Student Leader and finally in P6, I was selected to be the President of the Student Leaders’ Council.</p><p>Teachers of Townsville Primary School place students at the center of all they do. I am deeply thankful to have completed my primary education journey in Townsville Primary School and I wish you would have a fruitful journey as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yours Sincerely,</p><p>Adway Lakshminarayanan</p><p>President. Student Leaders’ Council 2023.</p>

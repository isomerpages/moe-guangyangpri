<h1>Learning for Life (LLP): iDARE2 through the Arts</h1><p>The Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in Townsville,&nbsp;<strong>iDARE2 through the Arts</strong>, provides our students with real-life experiential learning to develop their character and values, sense of empathy, joy of learning, cultivate positive attitudes, self-expression and interpersonal skills through Visual and Performing Arts. iDARE2 represents the school core values - Integrity, Diligence, Aspiration, Respect, Empathy, which the school hopes to develop in the students.&nbsp;</p><p>A 3-tiered structure catering to different learning experiences, interests and abilities is implemented to achieve these aims:</p><p><strong>Our goal</strong>: To nurture future ready, confident and passionate Townsvillites through the Visual and Performing Arts</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Student Development Through 3 Tiers</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p><strong>Exposure</strong> to the Arts – <strong>Arts Adventurers</strong></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Values focused on iD – Integrity, Diligence</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Extension</strong> with the Arts&nbsp; – <strong>Arts Performers</strong></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Values focused on AR – Aspiration, Respect</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Excellence</strong> in Character Through the Arts – <strong>Arts Champions</strong></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Values focused on Empathy, Excellence</p></li></ul></li></ul><p></p></li></ul><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Signature Programmes/llp2023new.png"></div><p>For Visual Art, students are exposed to various Master, Local and Student Artists. Besides the art-making process, students are further engaged through art-making discussions, writing their artist statements/reflections and self/peer art critique. Students also have opportunities to be involved in the real-life application of product design.</p><p>Selected students’ art works are on display at our very own in-house art galleries: Our Young Passionate Artists Wall and The Arte. This allows students to learn more from their friends as artists, model after them, integrate ideas and draw inspirations from their works, and be encouraged to create their own expression of visual arts. The LLP structure is also designed to provide support for all students with different aptitude/interest (three-tier approach).</p><p>For Performing Art, students are exposed to 4 main components: (1) Singing (2) Theory and Composing&nbsp; (3) Listening and Responding to Music – Cultural Appreciation and (4) Ensemble Playing through the Music lessons. Music literacy is developed through reading and performance based conventional and non-conventional notation leading to self-expression and creativity. Students are given opportunity to learn different instruments through the different cohort programmes</p><p>Selected students who excel in the performing arts are invited to join the wide array of the Performing arts CCA, namely:&nbsp;</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>A# Handbell</p></li><li><p>Angklung &amp; Kulintang</p></li><li><p>Choir&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>International Dance&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>In these CCAs, they get further exposure and experience in the CCAs through being part of public performances and the Singapore Youth Festival Art Presentations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

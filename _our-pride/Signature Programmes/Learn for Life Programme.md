<h1 style="color:red;font-size:30px">Learning for Life (LLP): iDARE through the Arts</h1>


The Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in Townsville, **iDARE through the Arts**, provides our students with real-life experiential learning to develop their character and values, sense of empathy, joy of learning, cultivate positive attitudes, self-expression and interpersonal skills through Visual and Performing Arts. iDARE represents the school core values - Integrity, Diligence, Aspiration, Respect, Empathy, which the school hopes to develop in the students. 

A 3-tiered structure catering to different learning experiences, interests and abilities is implemented to achieve these aims:

For Visual Art, students are exposed to various Master, Local and Student Artists. Besides the art-making process, students are further engaged through art-making discussions, writing their artist statements/reflections and self/peer art critique. Students also have opportunities to be involved in the real-life application of product design.

Selected students’ art works are on display at our very own in-house art galleries: Our Young Passionate Artists Wall and The Arte. This allows students to learn more from their friends as artists, model after them, integrate ideas and draw inspirations from their works, and be encouraged to create their own expression of visual arts. The LLP structure is also designed to provide support for all students with different aptitude/interest (three-tier approach).

For Performing Art, students are exposed to 4 main components: (1) Singing (2) Theory and Composing  (3) Listening and Responding to Music – Cultural Appreciation and (4) Ensemble Playing through the Music lessons. Music literacy is developed through reading and performance based conventional and non-conventional notation leading to self-expression and creativity. Students are given opportunity to learn different instruments through the different cohort programmes: 

\[P2 Kompany\]

\[P4 & P5 Music Interest Groups\]

\[P6 End of Year Programme\]

\[School Assemblies\]

Selected students who excel in the performing arts are invited to join the wide array of the Performing arts CCA, namely: 

*   A# Handbell
    
*   Angklung & Kulintang
    
*   Choir 
    
*   International Dance 

In these CCAs, they get further exposure and experience in the CCAs through being part of public performances and the Singapore Youth Festival Art Presentations. Below are some pictures of the past performances:

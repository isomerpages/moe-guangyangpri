<h1 style="color:red;font-size:30px">Programme for Active Learning&nbsp; (PAL)</h1>


PAL is an integral part of the curriculum for all Primary 1 and 2 students. The programme offersÂ  hands-on and experiential learning through the following four domains: Sports & Games, Outdoor Education, Visual Arts, and Performing Arts.

PAL provides opportunities for students to discover new interests, develop character and enables them to develop social-emotional competencies.

The PAL modules aim for students to develop confidence in what they do, develop a sense of curiosity and positive attitude towards learning and enjoy group experiences and teamwork.

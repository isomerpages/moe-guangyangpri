Through this 10-hour standardised curriculum, students are exposed to coding and computational thinking and their applications to daily lives. Students will undergo sessions that allow them to understand basic programming concepts and develop logical thinking and problem-solving skills. They are given opportunities to apply their knowledge gained through an activity where they will individually programme a dance using their Sphero robotic kits. Students are also introduced to basic concepts of emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and cybersecurity concepts.</p>

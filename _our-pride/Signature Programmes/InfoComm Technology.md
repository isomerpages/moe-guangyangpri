<h3>ICT Committee Goal</h3>
<p><em>To nurture each pupil in TVPS to be Competent Users of ICT</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Approach</strong>
<br>The ICT Committee adopts a holistic approach to the learning of appropriate
skills and values towards ICT usage.&nbsp; Our programme seeks to enable
pupils to become competent users of ICT.</p>
<p>In line with the schoolâ€™s ethos of preparing learners for life, ICT skills
are taught to students to equip them with the necessary InfoComm skills
to engage learning.&nbsp; The planned exposure and skills are designed
to ignite their learning and allow them the means to maximize their potential
not just as consumers of technology but as creators with technology.</p>
<p><strong>Foundation ICT Lessons:</strong>
<br>The Foundation series (P1 to P4) aims to equip students with access to
the various learning platforms within the MOE ICT ecosystem, such as Student
Learning Space, Student Icon; and also build basic competencies in the
use of collaborative tools, Data Collection tools, and Presentation and
Production skills.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>From Primary 1 to Primary 3 - We build the foundations for ICT use.</strong></h4>

<p>Students learn the use of these within the context of their English Lessons,
applying these skills to complete tasks within their English Curriculum
and using these skills in conjunction with their learning of the English
Language.</p>

<p>Students continue their use of these tools within their English Language
learning, utilising the storage capabilities of google drive to store and
continually work on their work. At the end of Primary 2 students submit
a written work of their own to their teachers via google classroom.</p>
<p><strong>Primary 3</strong>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Students at Primary 3 learning new skills and their use within the context
of Social Studies, deploying these skills to actively collaborate with
each other on presentation slides and using google docs to collaboratively
work on scripting.&nbsp; The tasks employed are to encourage students to
use technology to work collaboratively, developing their 21st Century Skills
as well as technology tools that enable collaborative work remotely.&nbsp;
These form the foundation for technology enabled learning.</p>
<p><strong>Primary 4 - To be implemented in 2026</strong>
</p>
<p>Upper Primary ICT Lessons:
<br>The upper primary series of ICT lessons will focus on equipping our students
to be producers versus consumers of content.
<br>
<br>It will focus on giving them basic skills in creation of content on platforms
such as video and adobe, providing them with opportunities in video production
and editing, use of tools such as photoshop.&nbsp; These take place within
the subject areas of Art and Music.</p>
<p><strong>For Primary 5</strong>
<br>Video editing and use of photoshop.&nbsp; Music making with apps such
as Garageband.</p>
<p><strong>For Primary 6</strong>
<br>Coding for Fun - The Code For Fun (CFF) Enrichment Programme is a national-mandated
programme that is offered to Primary 6 students in TVPS. Through this 10-hour
standardised curriculum, students are exposed to coding and computational
thinking and their applications to daily lives. Students will undergo sessions
that allow them to understand basic programming concepts and develop logical
thinking and problem-solving skills. They are given opportunities to apply
their knowledge gained through an activity where they will individually
programme a dance using their Sphero robotic kits. Students are also introduced
to basic concepts of emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence
and cybersecurity concepts.</p>
<p>Coding for Fun is the finale programme that exposes students to programming.</p>

As Teachers’ Day is approaching, the school would like to take this opportunity to invite you to show your appreciation to our teachers.

You may either use the softcopy appreciation card and send the completed card through the school’s email [gyps@moe.edu.sg](mailto:gyps@moe.edu.sg) or use the hardcopy card which will be given to your child/ward on Friday, 6 August 2021. If you would like to show your appreciation to more than one teacher, kindly use one card for each teacher. You may get your child/ward to submit the completed cards to our staff at the General Office by **Wednesday,** **25 August 2021**.

Your encouragement and affirmation of our teachers is valuable and I would like to thank you for taking time and effort to do so.

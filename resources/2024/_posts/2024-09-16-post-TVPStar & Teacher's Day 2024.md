<h4><strong>TVPStar Celebrates a Decade of Talent with "Our Teachers, Our Inspiration"</strong></h4>
<p>We are thrilled to announce that TVPStar has reached its tenth edition!
This year’s theme, “Our Teachers, Our Inspiration,” was a heartfelt tribute
to our dedicated educators who inspire and motivate our students every
day.</p>
<p>In alignment with our Learning for Life Programme (LLP)'s vision, which
focuses on nurturing future-ready, confident, and passionate Townsvillites
through the Arts, TVPStar continues to be a vibrant platform for showcasing
our students’ aesthetic talents and creativity.</p>
<p>We were excited to see 35 students participate in auditions via videoconferencing,
and from these, 10 outstanding finalists were selected. On August 29th,
in celebration of Teachers’ Day, these finalists dazzled us with their
musical skills—performing both vocally and instrumentally—before an audience
of teachers, peers, and parents.</p>
<p>The event concluded with a prize presentation by our esteemed Guest-of-Honour,
Mr. Kenneth Tan, a valued member of the School Advisory Committee Board.
All finalists were recognised with a trophy and certificate for their exceptional
performances.</p>
<p>We extend our deepest gratitude to our teachers and parents for their
unwavering support, which made this celebration possible.</p>
<p>Thank you for being part of this memorable occasion!</p>

<p>On November 4th, the graduating cohort came together to celebrate the
remarkable achievements of their peers during the <em>P6 Cohort Celebrates</em> event.
Students across all classes were honoured for their outstanding accomplishments,
both academic and non-academic, with accolades ranging from the <em>Young Linguists Award</em> to
the <em>Leaders of Character Award</em>. The ceremony was made even more
special as award recipients were presented with their certificates by those
who had supported and guided them throughout their journeyâ€” their Form
Teachers. A heartfelt congratulations to the Class of 2024 on this significant
milestone!</p>

<p>On 23 Aug 2024, Townsville Primary School and Land Transport Authority
revealed an art work done as a Community Project. The Art work, created
by 16 students assisted by their art teachers, will be displayed at a bus
stop, along Ang Mo Kio Ave 6, near block 205. We are proud of what our
students have accomplished and the creativity they have showcased in their
artwork.</p>

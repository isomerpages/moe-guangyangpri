The Moo-O Awards, a digital story-telling competition, is organised yearly to motivate students to read and speak fluently and expressively in English. Three of our students, Sapthavi Ganeswaran (3 Courage),  Liu Siyu (3 Loyalty) and Adele Zhan Ya Shi (3 Teamwork) took part in the Moo-O Awards 2022, supported by the Speak Good English Movement where they clinched the Gold Award. Our students used the Moo-O software to portray themselves as various story characters. They were articulate, fluent and expressive as they read the story. Congratulations!

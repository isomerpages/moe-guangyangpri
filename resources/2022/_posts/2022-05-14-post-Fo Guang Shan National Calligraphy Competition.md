All our Chinese students from Primary 3 to Primary 6 took part in our School Calligraphy Competition in March. The best 3 entries from each class were selected and submitted for entry to the Fo Guang Shan National Calligraphy Competition. Three of them did the school proud by qualifying for the Final on 16 April (Saturday). Foo Kai Xin Kelly (6 Courage) and Yong Xi Neng (6 Courage) were both awarded the Merit Award in the Primary School category while Nguyen Ngoc Ha Anh (5 Honesty) received a Cultural Award. Well done, girls!

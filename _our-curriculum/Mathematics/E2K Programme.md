<p><strong>The E2K Mathematics Programme</strong> Singapore is a Mathematics enrichment programme for selected Primary 4 and 5 pupils who demonstrate interest and ability in Mathematics. It aims to develop in pupils mathematical reasoning skills and deepen their conceptual understanding through an inquiry approach. Pupils will have opportunities to collaborate with their peers and engage in mathematical thinking through resources such as puzzles, games and mathematics explorations which are specially designed for the programme. The rich learning experiences offered by the programme serve to help pupils to develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions mathematicians possess, as well as to gain important 21st century competencies such as critical and inventive thinking and effective communication skills.</p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Maths/maths 9.jpg"></div></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Maths/maths 4.jpg"></div></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Maths/maths 11.jpg"></div></th></tr></tbody></table><p></p>

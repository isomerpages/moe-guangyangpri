<h1>Co-Curricular Activities (CCA)</h1>
<p><strong>Vision</strong>
</p>
<p>Lifelong learners who excel in the the rapidly changing world</p>
<p><strong>Teaching Approach</strong>
</p>
<p>Using the 3Es Approach, our CCA programme provides students with Exposure,
Experience and Excellence. Through our programmes, students are taught
values, Character and Citizenship Education (CCE), Social-Emotional Learning
(SEL) and given opportunities to become self-directed learners.</p>
<p>Co-curricular Activities (CCA) are an integral part of our students’ holistic
education. Students discover their interests and talents while developing
values and competencies that will prepare them for a rapidly changing world.
CCA also promotes friendships among students from diverse backgrounds as
they learn, play and grow together. Participation in CCA fosters social
integration and deepens students’ sense of belonging, commitment and sense
of responsibility to school, community and nation.</p>

<h1>Co-Curricular Activities (CCA)</h1>
<p><strong>Vision</strong>
</p>
<p>Lifelong learners who excel in the the rapidly changing world</p>
<p><strong>Teaching Approach</strong>
</p>
<p>Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) is integral to the holistic development of
students.&nbsp; Through the CCA, students are provided with varied and
authentic opportunities to develop character and 21<sup>st</sup> century
competencies. Our CCA programme taps on the 3E approach - <em>Exposure, Experience and Excellence</em> to
provide an experiential learning to our Townsvillities. Students are taught
values, Character and Citizenship Education (CCE), Social-Emotional Learning
(SEL) and are given opportunities to become self-directed learners.</p>
<p>Co-curricular Activities (CCA) are an integral part of our students’ holistic
education. Students discover their interests and talents while developing
values and competencies that will prepare them for a rapidly changing world.
CCA also promotes friendships among students from diverse backgrounds as
they learn, play and grow together. Participation in CCA fosters social
integration and deepens students’ sense of belonging, commitment and sense
of responsibility to school, community and nation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Townsville Primary School offers these CCAs based on these four sub-categories:</p>

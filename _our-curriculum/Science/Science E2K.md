<p><strong>The E2K Science Programme</strong> is an enrichment programme for
P4 and P5 students who demonstrate interest and aptitude in science. The
programme aims to develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions of scientists
as well as 21st century competencies such as critical and inventive thinking,
and effective communication skills. Through collaborative learning, students
engage in scientific investigations to discover and deepen their understanding
of advance science concepts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In partnership with Pathlight, our E2K students are given opportunities
to share and learn science concepts through engaging displays and experiments.
This collaboration not only deepens their understanding of scientific principles
but also cultivates an environment where diverse learners can build meaningful
connections, developing friendships and communication skills.</p>

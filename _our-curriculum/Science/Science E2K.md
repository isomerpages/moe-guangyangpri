<p><strong>The E2K Science Programme</strong> is an enrichment programme for P4 and P5 students who demonstrate interest and aptitude in science. The programme aims to develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions of scientists as well as 21st century competencies such as critical and inventive thinking, and effective communication skills. Through collaborative learning, students engage in scientific investigations to discover and deepen their understanding of advance science concepts.</p><p></p><p>In partnership with Pathlight, our E2K students are given opportunities to share and learn science concepts through engaging displays and experiments. This collaboration not only deepens their understanding of scientific principles but also cultivates an environment where diverse learners can build meaningful connections, developing friendships and communication skills.</p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="2"><p></p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>

<p><strong>Strive/MTSP</strong>
</p>
<p>The Mother Tongue Support Programme (MTSP) is a specialized initiative
designed to strengthen the learning of Mother Tongue Languages for Primary
3 and 4 students. The programme focuses on building a strong foundation
in listening and speaking skills before gradually advancing to reading
and writing. By providing an immersive language environment enriched with
engaging activities and games, MTSP fosters an enjoyable and effective
learning experience. Through this initiative, we aim to empower students
to become confident and proficient learners of their Mother Tongue Languages.</p>

both exciting and impactful. Through activities such as role play, show-and-tell,

<p>At Townsville Primary School, our Mother Tongue lessons bring language
to life by immersing students in the rich traditions and values of their
heritage. Through hands-on experiences during festive celebrations and
the vibrant Mother Tongue Language Fortnight, students not only acquire
language skills but also develop a profound appreciation for their cultural
roots. These engaging lessons foster pride, respect, and a deep sense of
identity, making the learning journey both meaningful and unforgettable.</p>

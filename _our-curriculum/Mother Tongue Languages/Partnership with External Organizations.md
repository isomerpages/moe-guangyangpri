<p>Cultural Immersion Visit</p>
<p>As part of Mother Tongue Fortnight, students from partner schools visit
our school to participate in cultural immersion activities. They engage
in hands-on experiences, such as Batik Painting in Malay Language classes
and 'Thoranum' making in Tamil Language lessons. These activities help
students appreciate the traditions and stories behind the crafts, fostering
a deeper understanding of Singapore's multicultural heritage.</p>

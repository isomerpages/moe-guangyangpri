<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>Effective communicator in Mother Tongue, rooted in one’s culture, ready
for the future.</p>
<p><strong>Teaching Approach</strong>
</p>
<p>At Townsville Primary School, we strive to cultivate a positive and dynamic
learning environment that motivates students to become confident communicators
and lifelong learners. Through focusing on six essential language skills—Listening,
Speaking, Reading, Writing, Speaking Interaction, and Written Interaction—students
develop the foundation to communicate effectively and confidently in their
Mother Tongue.</p>
<p>Our curriculum integrates 21st-century competencies (21st CC) that empower
students with social knowledge, global awareness, and an appreciation for
humanistic values, such as moral integrity and traditional culture. This
ensures that our students not only develop strong language skills but also
become responsible and culturally conscious individuals who are ready for
the future.</p>
<p>To foster critical thinking, collaboration, and independence, we use structured
thinking frameworks such as 5W1H (Who, What, Where, When, Why, How), Mind-mapping,
Think-Pair-Share, and PEEL (Point, Evidence, Explain, Link). These strategies
help students engage with the content meaningfully, enhance their language
proficiency, develop problem-solving skills and take ownership of their
learning journey.</p>
<p>At Townsville Primary School, we are committed to shaping confident, capable
learners who are not only proficient in their Mother Tongue but also rooted
in cultural values, prepared for a rapidly changing world.</p>

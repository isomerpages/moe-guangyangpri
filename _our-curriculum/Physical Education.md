The PE programme aims to develop students in the 3 main domains of psychomotor, cognitive and affective.

The lower primary PE programme focuses on the acquisition of fundamental motor skills such as locomotor, non-locomotor and manipulative skills, as well as movement concepts to develop students into effective, efficient and versatile individuals.&nbsp;

In the upper primary, the PE programme extends into the acquisition and development of combination skills, sequences of movements and application of game concepts across different sports and games.

The P5 Outdoor Adventure Camp took place at Changi Coast Outdoor Adventure Learning Centre (OALC) in April this year. This was the first camp since the merger and also with the resumption of height based activities e.g abseiling, rock climbing etc. The students enjoyed the outdoor activities immensely which were designed to help them to appreciate nature, build camaraderie with their peers and develop resilience in the 3 day 2 night camp.

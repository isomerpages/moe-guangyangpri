<p style="font-size:20px"><strong>Vision</strong></p>To nurture pupils who are physically fit and adopt a healthy lifestyle.

<p style="font-size:20px"><strong>Teaching Approach</strong></p>
The PE programme aims to develop students in the 3 main domains of psychomotor, cognitive and affective.

The lower primary PE programme focuses on the acquisition of fundamental motor skills such as locomotor, non-locomotor and manipulative skills, as well as movement concepts to develop students into effective, efficient and versatile individuals.&nbsp;

In the upper primary, the PE programme extends into the acquisition and development of combination skills, sequences of movements and application of game concepts across different sports and games.

7 Learning Areas in Physical Education:
*   Athletics (From P3 onwards)
*   Dance    
*   Games &amp; Sports    
*   Gymnastics    
*   Outdoor Education    
*   Physical Health and Fitness   
*   Swimming (P4)

Some examples of SEP conducted include:

*   Inline Skating
*   Archery
*   Tchoukball    
*   Golf
    

<u>Jump Jam</u>

The Jump Jam Programme is conducted once a term with the aim of promoting a healthy and active lifestyle among students and staff. Each session will last for approximately 15 minutes, with different genres of music used, from the latest and popular upbeat pop and hip-hop tunes to soothing and calming Asian rhythms. Selected students were also given the opportunity to lead the school during the sessions. The Jump Jam Programme enabled everyone, from students to School Leaders, to exercise together in a fun and exciting manner.

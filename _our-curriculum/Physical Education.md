<h1>Physical Education</h1>
<p><strong>Vision</strong>
</p>
<p>To nurture pupils who are physically fit and adopt a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p><strong>Teaching Approach</strong>
</p>
<p>The PE programme aims to develop students in the 3 main domains of psychomotor,
cognitive and affective.</p>
<p>The lower primary PE programme focuses on the acquisition of fundamental
motor skills such as locomotor, non-locomotor and manipulative skills,
as well as movement concepts to develop students into effective, efficient
and versatile individuals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the upper primary, the PE programme extends into the acquisition and
development of combination skills, sequences of movements and application
of game concepts across different sports and games.</p>

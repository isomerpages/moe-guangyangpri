<p style="font-size:20px"><strong>Vision</strong></p>To nurture pupils who are physically fit and adopt a healthy lifestyle.

<p style="font-size:20px"><strong>Teaching Approach</strong></p>

The PE programme aims to develop students in the 3 main domains of psychomotor, cognitive and affective.

The lower primary PE programme focuses on the acquisition of fundamental motor skills such as locomotor, non-locomotor and manipulative skills, as well as movement concepts to develop students into effective, efficient and versatile individuals. 

In the upper primary, the PE programme extends into the acquisition and development of combination skills, sequences of movements and application of game concepts across different sports and games.

7 Learning Areas in Physical Education:

*   Athletics (From P3 onwards)

*   Games & Sports
    
*   Gymnastics

Sports Carnival

1.  The Sports Carnival takes place on the eve of Children’s Day annually, and also coincides with the end of the PSLE exams. Students from the upper primary levels get the chance to try out novel games such as Kinball, Archery Tag, Human Foosball and Bouncy Soccer, while students in the lower primary level compete against each other in fun and engaging telematches. All in all, it is a day of enjoyment and excitement for the students as they celebrate Children’s Day.

2.  Sports Education Program (SEP)

The Sports Education Program (SEP) aims to expose students to a variety of sports not included in the PE syllabus. It is conducted once a year for each level as part of the post-exam activities to encourage students to learn beyond classroom PE lessons. The SEP helps generate interest in students and teaches them basic skills required to play the various sports.

Some examples of SEP conducted include:
*   Mini Bounce (Trampoline)
    
*   Inline Skating
    
*   Archery
    
*   Tchoukball
    
*   Golf

Students enjoy learning a new sport with their peers

1.  Jump Jam
    

The Jump Jam Programme is conducted twice a term with the aim of promoting a healthy and active lifestyle among students and staff. Each session will last for approximately 15 minutes, with different genres of music used, from the latest and popular upbeat pop and hip-hop tunes to soothing and calming Asian rhythms. Selected students were also given the opportunity to lead the school during the sessions. The Jump Jam Programme enabled everyone, from students to School Leaders, to exercise together in a fun and exciting manner.

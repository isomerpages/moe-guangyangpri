<a id="1"></a>

Department Goals
----------------

To nurture pupils who are physically fit and adopt a healthy lifestyle.  
To engage pupils in mass physical activities.  
To provide pupils with quality PE lessons & CCA opportunities and activities.

Approach
--------

The PE programme for lower primary level focuses on mastery of fundamental motor skills such as locomotor, non-locomotor and manipulative skills with application of movement concepts to develop efficiency, effectiveness and versatility in pupils’ performance. Once the foundation is laid, the upper primary level extends the mastery of discrete skills to focusing on more complex combinations, sequences of movements, and skills application in more recognisable forms of activity and games.

7 Learning Areas in Physical Education:  
• Games and Sports  
• Gymnastics  
• Dance  
• Outdoor Education  
• Swimming  
• Physical Health & Fitness (Previously known as Health Education)  
• Athletics

Co-Curricular
-------------

Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) are integral in ensuring that pupils receive a well-rounded and holistic education. It serves as a platform on which pupils can develop good character, hone their leadership skills and be active contributors to the community.

Based on the belief that individuals thrive in an environment in which all their abilities and talents are recognised and nurtured, the school promotes active participation in the co-curricular activities to develop pupils in their physical, affective and aesthetic domains.

Every pupil in Primary 1 and Primary 2 will participate in Programme for Active Learning (PAL). Every pupil from Primary 3 to Primary 6 is strongly encouraged to participate in at least one CCA of their choice.

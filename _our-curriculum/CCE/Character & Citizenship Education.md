<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>A resilient and responsible Townsvillite; a compassionate and active member
of the community.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Teaching Approach</h4>
<p>The CCE curriculum is based on the three big ideas of Identity, Relationships
and Choices. It involves the teaching and learning of core values and social-emotional
competencies with a focus on developing a sense of purpose in our students.</p>
<p>At Townsville, teachers use the SEE approach to create key Student Development
Experiences to provide students with varied and authentic opportunities
to learn, apply and demonstrate good values, good character, social-emotional
competencies and citizenship dispositions.</p>
<p><strong><u>SEE Approach</u></strong>

</ol>
<p>Students learn to recognise and clarify their values through the process
of perspective taking and reflections. They will be equipped with skills
to navigate various life circumstances and guide them in making responsible
decisions. Most importantly, students will undergo a cycle of participating,
reflecting, thinking, and acting to internalise their learning experiences.</p>

<h4><strong><u>Cohort Learning Journeys</u></strong></h4>
<p>Cohort LJs provide all students with opportunities to explore their Singaporean
identity through the arts, culture and heritage. These cohort LJs have
been specially curated for students’ formative years for the development
of citizenship dispositions and national identity. They complement the
national Art, Music, Character and Citizenship Education and Social Studies
curricula. Cohort LJs consist of the Primary 5 NE Show and Museum-Based
Learning (MBL).</p>

<h4><strong><u>Values in Action</u></strong></h4>
<p>VIA is a learning experience that develops students as active and socially
responsible citizens. VIA provides opportunities for students to demonstrate
the values they learn and contribute meaningfully at home, school and community.
VIA learning experiences are scaffolded through developmentally appropriate
activities: Lower primary students progressively take responsibility for
their own spaces in class and at home, while upper primary students can
take action to make a difference to their school and the community.</p>

<h4><strong><u>Education and Career Guidance</u></strong></h4>
<p>ECG experiences equip students with the necessary knowledge, skills and
values to make informed decisions at each key education stage for successful
transition from school to further education or work. At Townsville, ECG
experiences raise students’ awareness of the different education and career
pathways that are suited to their values, interests, personality and skills.</p>

<h4><strong><u>SIR/KIR Programme</u></strong></h4>
<p>The Start-It-Right (SIR) and Keep-It-Right (KIR) are structured in students’
weekly timetables where the school’s iDARE2 values and Student’s Creed
are taught explicitly. Through case studies, discussion and reflections,
students are guided through the process of responsible decision making
that is anchored on values and expected behaviours.</p>

<h4><strong><u>Project Sparkle</u></strong></h4>
<p>The Project Sparkle project focuses on developing in students the values
of responsibility, respect and care for environment. Students can show
care for their own shared spaces through daily cleaning and adopting sustainability
practices in school and at home. At the end of each term, a thorough wipe
down and clean-up of the classrooms are done to ensure the class is ready
for the following term.</p>

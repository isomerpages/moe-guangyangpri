<h3>Vision</h3><p>A resilient and responsible Townsvillite; a compassionate and active member of the community.</p><hr><h4>Teaching Approach</h4><p>The CCE curriculum is based on the three big ideas of Identity, Relationships and Choices. It involves the teaching and learning of core values and social-emotional competencies with a focus on developing a sense of purpose in our students.</p><p>These fundamentals are taught and applied in the six curriculum content areas of CCE:</p><ol><li><p>National Education</p></li><li><p>Sexuality Education</p></li><li><p>Mental Health</p></li><li><p>Education and Career Guidance</p></li><li><p>Cyber Wellness</p></li><li><p>Family Education</p></li></ol><p>At Townsville, CCE is an ongoing, lifelong journey that unfolds through diverse experiences. Teachers use the SEE approach to craft and support these experiences to facilitate effective learning and attain the CCE's learning outcomes. These experiences are carefully tailored to suit the needs and interests of our students, optimizing their relevance through genuine and meaningful ties to real-world situations.</p><p><strong><u>SEE Approach</u></strong></p><ol data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p><u>S</u>tories and scenarios<br></p></li><li><p><u>E</u>xplicit skills instruction<br></p></li><li><p><u>E</u>xperiential learning<br></p></li></ol><p>Through the SEE approach, students learn to recognise and clarify their values through the process of perspective taking and reflections. Students will be equipped with important social and emotional skills to assist them in navigating various life circumstances and guide them in making responsible decisions. Most importantly, students will undergo a cycle of participating, reflecting, thinking, and acting to internalise their learning experiences.</p><h4><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h4><p>There are several learning platforms where CCE is enacted with intentionality. These include CCE lessons during curriculum time, planned student development learning experiences beyond the classroom, teachable moments during other subject lessons and learning opportunities beyond school.<br></p><ol data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p><strong><u>CCE Lessons</u></strong></p></li></ol><p>A dedicated curriculum time for the explicit teaching and learning of values and social-emotional competencies, as well as engaging and building relationships with our students:</p><p>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CCE (FTGP)<br>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CCE (MTL)<br>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PAL (P1 and P2)<br><u>P2 PAL: Terrarium Building</u></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCE/1.JPG"></div><ol start="2" data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p><strong><u>Student Development Experiences (SDEs)</u></strong></p></li></ol><p>SDEs are programmes and activities that contribute towards the holistic development of our students in physical, aesthetic, intellectual, moral, and social domains:</p><p>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Co-Curricular Activities;<br>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cohort Learning Journeys;<br>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Education and Career Guidance Experiences;<br>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; National Education;<br>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Outdoor Adventure Learning Cohort Camps;<br>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Student Leadership Development Programmes; and<br>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Values in Action</p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><h4>Cohort Learning Journeys</h4></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>P6 @ Asian Civilisation Museum</strong></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCE/2.jpg"></div></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>P4 @ Geylang Serai Heritage Gallery</strong></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCE/3.jpeg"></div></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>P4 @ Kreta Ayer Heritage Gallery</strong></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCE/4.jpg"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><h4>Total Defence Day</h4></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCE/5.JPG"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><h4>Racial Harmony Day</h4></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCE/6.jpg"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><h4>National Day</h4></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCE/7.JPG"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><h4><strong>Recess Integration </strong></h4></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Integration Programme with Pathlight School</strong></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCE/8.JPG"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><h4><strong>Community Engagement</strong></h4></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Engagement Programme with Lion’s Befriender</strong></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCE/9.jpeg"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><p><br></p><ol start="3" data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p><strong><u>School-based Initiatives</u></strong></p></li></ol><p>At Townsville, students also undergo uniquely designed experiences to foster a caring and enabling school environment for learning:</p><p><strong>Project Sparkle</strong></p><p>Under the supervision of Eco Student Leaders, students develop a sense of responsibility and care for their environment through daily cleaning and adopting sustainable practices in school.

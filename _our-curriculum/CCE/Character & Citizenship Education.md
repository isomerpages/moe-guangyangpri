<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>A resilient and responsible Townsvillite; a compassionate and active member
of the community.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Teaching Approach</h4>
<p>The CCE curriculum is based on the three big ideas of Identity, Relationships
and Choices. It involves the teaching and learning of core values and social-emotional
competencies with a focus on developing a sense of purpose in our students.</p>
<p>At Townsville, teachers use the SEE approach to create key Student Development
Experiences to provide students with varied and authentic opportunities
to learn, apply and demonstrate good values, good character, social-emotional
competencies and citizenship dispositions.</p>
<p><strong><u>SEE Approach</u></strong>

</ol>
<p>Students learn to recognise and clarify their values through the process
of perspective taking and reflections. They will be equipped with skills
to navigate various life circumstances and guide them in making responsible
decisions. Most importantly, students will undergo a cycle of participating,
reflecting, thinking, and acting to internalise their learning experiences.</p>

<h4><strong><u>Project Sparkle</u></strong></h4>
<p>The Project Sparkle project focuses on developing in students the values
of responsibility, respect and care for environment. Students can show
care for their own shared spaces through daily cleaning and adopting sustainability
practices in school and at home. At the end of each term, a thorough wipe
down and clean-up of the classrooms are done to ensure the class is ready
for the following term.</p>

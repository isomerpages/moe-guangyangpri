<p><strong>NE Show 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>On Saturday, 29 June, our Primary 5 students attended the National Education
(NE) Show at the Padang. The theme for this year’s National Day Parade
(NDP) is “Together, As One United People” which highlights the collective
strength of our people and underscores the importance of every citizen
rallying together to share our future and uplift those around us. On top
of experiencing the mesmerising spectacle and jubilant atmosphere of the
NDP, our students gained a deeper appreciation for Singapore and its history.</p>

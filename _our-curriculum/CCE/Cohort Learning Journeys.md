<h4><strong><u>Cohort Learning Journeys</u></strong></h4>
<p>Cohort LJs provide all students with opportunities to explore their Singaporean
identity through the arts, culture and heritage. These cohort LJs have
been specially curated for studentsâ€™ formative years for the development
of citizenship dispositions and national identity. They complement the
national Art, Music, Character and Citizenship Education and Social Studies
curricula. Cohort LJs consist of the Primary 5 NE Show and Museum-Based
Learning (MBL).</p>

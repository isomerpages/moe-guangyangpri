### Department Goals
To nurture passionate learners who are confident and articulate in English.

### Approach

#### STELLAR
Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading (STELLAR) is used in designing the English Language curriculum in our school. Through STELLAR, we strongly believe our pupils will develop into wholesome individuals who are confident, curious and have a desire to learn. They will also be able to communicate clearly and work well in teams and across cultures.

The STELLAR programme aims to cultivate the love of reading as well as to build a strong language foundation. It involves using age-appropriate resources and research based teaching strategies to engage our pupils in their learning of the language.

The key strategies used in the Lower Primary classrooms are as follows:

* **Shared Book Approach (SBA)**

Children read storybooks with the teacher and engage in oral discussions with teacher and peers.

* **Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA)**

The teacher models writing using pupils’ language. Pupils engage in writing together and in writing independently.

 **Learning Centres (LC)**

The teacher prepares mini lessons based on specific needs of pupils to prepare them for reading and writing activities; eg. grammar, vocabulary, word recognition, decoding skills and spelling.

The key strategies used in the Upper Primary classrooms are as follows:

* **Sustained Silent Reading (SSR)**

Pupils read silently without interruption and engage in oral discussions with teacher and peers after reading.

* **Supported Reading (SR)**

Pupils will read aloud or silently to comprehend a variety of texts at literal, inferential and evaluative levels. It also includes whole study text, grammar and vocabulary studies.

* **Know-Want to know-Learnt (KWL)**

Pupils extract information and relate it to what they already know about the topic. Teachers guide pupils to organise, access and remember information. This enables pupils to understand and follow the logic of information presented in a text.

* **Retelling (RT)**

Pupils are given opportunities to engage in a whole range of important language and cognitive processes including recall of information, main points and characters, text structures and language features.

* **Writing Process Cycle (WPC)**

The teacher models writing using pupil’s language. Pupils engage in writing together and in writing independently.

* **Differentiated Instruction (DI)**

Pupils are provided with differentiated support at various points of instruction to optimise their learning.

### Intervention Programmes

**Learning Support Programme (LSP)**

The LSP is a specialised early intervention programme which aims at providing learning support to pupils who enter Primary 1 with weak English language and literacy skills. Pupils are identified for LSP through a systematic screening process which is carried out at the beginning of Primary 1. The objective of the LSP is to equip pupils with basic literacy skills so that they can access learning in the regular classroom.

**School-based Dyslexia Remediation (SDR)**

SDR is a two year intervention programme for Primary 3 and 4 pupils who are identified through a systematic screening process for dyslexia which is conducted at the end of Primary 2. The programme is conducted in small groups by trained teachers using a reading curriculum designed by MOE reading specialists.

**Reading Remediation Programme (RRP)**

The Reading Remediation Programme is aimed at supporting P3 pupils who face consistent difficulty in reading in the English Language despite having completed the Learning Support Programme in P1 and P2. The programme enables pupils to master word recognition and spelling strategies. It also exposes them to a range of strategies for reading comprehension which will enable them to better manage their daily learning.

<h1 style="color:red;font-size:30px">English Language</h1>

<p style="font-size:20px"><strong>Vision</strong></p>Every Townsvillite is a:

Confident and effective communicator
Discerning reader who is self-directed and passionate


<p style="font-size:20px"><strong>Teaching Approach</strong></p>

@TVPS we work towards cultivating the learning of the English Language through 3 aspects; the heart, mind and hand. This engaged learning culture is what we engineer here at Townsville.

Exposure. Experience. Environment.

*   The 2020 Syllabus was implemented from primary 1 in 2020 with greater emphasis on metacognition, multi-literacies and inquiry through dialogue. This will be achieved through explicit focus on differentiated instruction and assessment for learning
    

*   The 3Es approach in designing lesson experiences for each STELLAR theme in our curriculum, provides the rich exposure to meaningfully engage our students in building a strong foundation in the areas of listening, speaking, reading, writing and grammar and vocabulary with an increased emphasis on the development of 21st century competencies.
    

Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading (STELLAR) is used in designing the English Language curriculum in our school. Through STELLAR, we strongly believe our students will develop into wholesome individuals who are confident, curious and have a desire to learn. They will also be able to communicate clearly and work well in teams and across cultures.

The STELLAR programme aims to cultivate the love of reading as well as to build a strong language foundation. It involves using age-appropriate resources and research based teaching strategies to engage our students in their learning of the language.

The LSP is a specialised early intervention programme which aims at providing learning support to pupils who enter Primary 1 with weak English language and literacy skills.

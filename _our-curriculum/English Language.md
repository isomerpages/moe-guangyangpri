### Department Goals
To nurture passionate learners who are confident and articulate in English.

### Approach

#### STELLAR
Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading (STELLAR) is used in designing the English Language curriculum in our school. Through STELLAR, we strongly believe our pupils will develop into wholesome individuals who are confident, curious and have a desire to learn. They will also be able to communicate clearly and work well in teams and across cultures.

The STELLAR programme aims to cultivate the love of reading as well as to build a strong language foundation. It involves using age-appropriate resources and research based teaching strategies to engage our pupils in their learning of the language.

The key strategies used in the Lower Primary classrooms are as follows:

* **Shared Book Approach (SBA)**

Children read storybooks with the teacher and engage in oral discussions with teacher and peers.

* **Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA)**

The teacher models writing using pupils’ language. Pupils engage in writing together and in writing independently.

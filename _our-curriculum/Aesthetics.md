### LIVE YOUR PASSION

GYPS Aesthetics Department is committed to providing all students with opportunities to engage and succeed in the arts. The needs and interests of every student is catered to through high quality and customised programmes. We tap on our multi-national student population which is a very unique resource to share their diverse cultural experiences through the Arts. Amidst a vibrant learning environment, students discover their innate talents from the classroom music curriculum to the application of the skills in the CCA Programme, transforming into gracious citizens of Singapore. Thus, the Aesthetics Department has developed its own vision and mission statements:

**_Vision:_** _An Artist in Everyone_

**_Mission:_** _Maximise the potential of each and every pupil in the Arts_

DEPARTMENT GOAL
---------------

GYPS pupils are able to express themselves confidently through Art and Music

APPROACH
--------

1.  In expressing themselves through the Arts, students develop their communication skills.
2.  Arts activities provide an avenue for students to express their emotions.
3.  Arts activities that enable students to work with their peers and help them develop 21st century skills.
4.  Arts programmes that cater to both the affective and cognitive domains of our students.

 The programme ‘LIVE YOUR PASSION’ aims to develop **performing arts** as the school’s niche. This is done through infusion in the school curriculum and after-school programmes.

‘Live Your Passion’ Programme for 2020 comprises 3 core components namely: the broad-based **Music Curriculum,** the complementary performing arts **Co-curricular Activities** that further develop interests**,** and the more specialised **‘A# (Sharp)’ Programme (Talent Development in Music)**

PROGRAMMES
----------

#### GYPS Arts Framework (Performing and Visual)

The programme caters to the whole pupil population as it is designed for two groups of pupils:

*   pupils with music background or who show good potential in at least 1 area of performing arts;
*   remaining pupil population without any music background.

A whole-school and broad-based approach is adopted for performing arts as a niche area. As shown in **Diagram A**, this is carried out through the school’s curricular and co-curricular programmes using the E3 Framework through the following stages of development: Exposure, Extension and Excellence. Based on the E3 Framework, the school plans and implements all components of ‘Live Your Passion’ (GYPS Arts Education Programme 2020) as shown in **Diagram B**.

**<u>Learning for Life Programme (LLP)</u>** 

Recognised and supported by the Ministry of Education, the LLP provides pupils with real-life experiential learning to develop their character and values. This includes inculcating positive attitudes and strengthening 21st century competencies. There is strong emphasis on professional development of teachers to ensure sustainability of the programme in the long term.

We are implementing a 3-tiered structure catering to different learning experiences, interests and abilities.

<h1><u>Music Curriculum</u></h1>


The school’s Classroom Music curriculum for all levels is delivered in 4 modules namely: (1) Singing (2) Theory and Composing  (3) Listening and Responding to Music – Cultural Appreciation and (4) Ensemble Playing. Music literacy is developed through reading and performance based conventional and non-conventional notation leading to self-expression and creativity. Pupils will then be shown how theoretical knowledge may be applied in the choreography of dances as well as in the areas of instrumental music and interpretation.

#### Primary 4 Cohort Programme – Annual Musical (2019)

Our P4 students confidently presented a theatrical dance performance entitled “Embracing a New Age”. Scripted by the students themselves, it represented the hopes and aspirations of all GYPS students. It depicted the way students learn in a futuristic environment, assisted by androids and robots. Coupled with a mindset of innovation and the courage to test out new inventions, they explored the use of futuristic transportation tools to connect the world. Tapping on their curiosity, they showed us how their knowledge of the life sciences and human DNA can be applied to benefit mankind.

#### GYPS Visual Arts Curriculum

The objectives of the GYPS Curriculum are achieved through the Primary Art Syllabus Framework in the figure below that encapsulates the key features of

![](/images/va1.jpeg)

the syllabus:

*   The three **Big Ideas** at the heart of the syllabus framework form the enduring understandings that provide focus for the teaching and learning of art.
*   The big ideas frame the three Learning Domains of **see**, **express** and **appreciate** that present learning opportunities for students to develop the Key Competencies of observe-inquire, create-innovate, and connect-respond.
*   Pupils learn to see, express and appreciate through the four key components of the Learning Content – **context**, **artistic processes**, **media** and **visual qualities**.
*   In the process, pupils acquire knowledge, skills and values that equip them to be active artists and informed audiences.

**The Syllabus 32**

From P1 to P6, pupils will be exposed to 32 selected artworks by Singapore and international master/contemporary artists as well as by students from our schools. To experience art making and art discussion meaningfully, these artworks are organised under three focus areas:

*   Self and Immediate Environment
*   Singapore Past, Present and Future
*   The World and Region We Live in

Learning from artworks allows our pupils to develop understanding of the big ideas in art.

These are some of the artworks which pupils will be looking at:

#### Singapore Youth Festival 2017

#### Visual Art Exhibition

**Category A (Primary 1 and 2)**

**“We Try New Things”**

In this Artwork, we imagine many colourful bubbles under the surface of the sea. We can see images of pokeballs, illuminatis, genetic cells and other interesting patterns. It may look like a cave with some awesome rock formations, explosions of a nebula, Martian’s eggs or even cells that we may not have discovered. They may not have a nucleus or anything but we will definitely enhance our imagination and continue to explore the secrets of the world.

**Category B (Primary 3 and 4)**

**“Teams with Open Minds”**

We enjoy doodling our imaginative ideas in circles of different sizes. The circles represent different groups of people coming together to unleash their creativity and share interesting ideas.

**Category C (Primary 5 and 6)**

**“We Reach Out and Embrace Our Differences”**

In school, we enjoy different types of learning experiences in different spaces such as gardens, library, art room, science laboratory, etc. The four colours represent our multi-racial society. We hope everyone can work together to build a vibrant Singapore that we all can be proud of.

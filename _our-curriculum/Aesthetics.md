![](/images/Aesthetics/Aesthetic.png)

Using the 3Es approach of Exposure, Extension and Excellence, we aim to cater to the different learning interests and abilities of our students by offering a varied range and levels of experiences. All students are given the&nbsp; opportunity to develop their skills in art appreciation and expression through our Visual Arts and Music curriculum. At the same time, students may also choose to further extend their learning in the Visual Arts via CCAs and other specialised programs offered by the school.

<p style="font-size:20px"><strong>Key Programmes</strong></p>

**Medium Exposure Programs**

One of the key aims of our art curriculum is to offer a wide range of experiences to our students. These experiences include working with and experimenting with a variety of art mediums, learning their properties and allowances for art making and expression. To enhance the learning of our students, we bring in experts or knowledgeable others to teach certain mediums. Currently, we run medium exposure programs for Printmaking and Ceramics for our P3 and P4 students respectively.

**Museum Based Learning**

Museum Based Learning is a core learning experience of the Primary art curriculum aimed to develop an appreciation for the arts through an authentic setting and context.&nbsp; It consists of pre-, during- and post-visit experiences to one of the local art museums/exhibitions. Students will be invited to hone their art discussion skills, making connections between artwork and their own experiences.

**Digital Art**

Our students are part of the Digital Generation and as such our curriculum also weaves in Digital mediums into art making and expression. Through our upper primary digital art program, our students get to explore the many possibilities of using various online applications to create visual imagery, whilst at the same time honing their digital skills.

**Fused Glass**

The P5 students go through a series of lessons on using glass as a unique art material. They learn the safety aspect of handling glass and the process of fusing glass into art pieces.


**Art Exhibitions**

A showcase at year-end of our students’ artworks features 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional art pieces chosen from each level, displaying the students’ accumulative learning during the year. We celebrate our students’ efforts and excellence, while giving them the encouragement to further pursue their interest and talent in Art.

**Music Busking**

Music Busking is a biannual event that serves as a platform for our students to showcase their musical interests to their peers during recess. Using the 3E approach, exposure is provided to everyone and budding performers get to have first-hand experience and strive for excellence during the performance.

**Talent Competitions**

Since 2015, TVPStar has always served as a platform for Townsvillites to show their appreciation towards their teachers through their talents in the performing arts during Teachers’ Day Celebration. Interested participants are encouraged to register and participate in the audition. Finalists are then selected and put up their best performance on the actual day. The show ends after a prize presentation and our finalists are presented with a trophy and certificate of award.

**Art and Music Scheme (AMIS) Instructor Programme**

Incorporated into our Music curriculum, AMIS programme invites external practitioners to deliver interesting music progammes. It aims to provide exposure to our students to new instrument and digital music programmes as an innovative way of learning music.

Different programmes are tiered and mapped out for Primary 3 and 6, so that our students will be able to experience an enriching musical journey in Townsville.

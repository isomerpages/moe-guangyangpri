The learning of Mathematics involves more than the basic acquisition of concepts and skills. Problem solving is the central focus of the Mathematics curriculum framework. It consists of 5 inter-related components, namely, Concepts, Skills, Processes, Attitudes and Metacognition.

Approach
--------

#### Concrete – Pictorial – Abstract (CPA)

The learning of Mathematics concepts is progressive starting from the use of manipulatives to pictorial cues and gradually to abstract representation.

#### E³ Mathematics

In GYPS, the focus of our Mathematics programme revolves around exploration, experience and excelling (E³ Mathematics) in the learning of Mathematics.

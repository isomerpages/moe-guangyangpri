<p style="font-size:20px"><strong>Teaching Approach</strong></p>
In Townsville, the learning of Math takes into cognizance our learners’ profiles, the innovations in pedagogies and affordance of technologies.

In our classrooms, we focus on providing students with learning experiences that encompasses the use of the Gradual Release of Responsibility model (GRR). This is done through Explicit Direct Instruction (EDI) and Polya’s UPDC thinking tool to ensure our students’ holistic development.

Our teachers create opportunities and space for our Townsvillites to explore and discover the joy of learning. Our lessons are structured accordingly such that the CPA (Concrete to Pictorial to Abstract) Approach is used to develop mathematical concepts. Learning experiences are designed to deepen conceptual understanding and make Mathematics come alive in the day to day classroom.

<p style="font-size:20px"><strong>Key Programmes</strong></p>

1\. <strong>Math E2K Programme</strong>
    

The E2K programme is an enrichment programme for selected Primary 4 and 5 students who demonstrate strong interest and ability in Mathematics. It aims to develop mathematical reasoning skills and deepen their conceptual understanding through an inquiry approach.


2\. <strong>Financial Literacy Programme</strong>
    

&nbsp;The Financial Literacy Programme is held termly and aims to teach our students to be financially literate and to develop healthy financial habits. This is done by equipping them with financial literacy knowledge through bite sized information and engaging activities shared through multimodal platforms.

3\. <strong>Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) Programme</strong>
    

The LSM programme is an early intervention programme for Primary 1 and Primary 2 students who need additional support to acquire basic numeracy skills. Lessons are conducted in small-sized groups so that teachers can provide more customized lessons for the students.

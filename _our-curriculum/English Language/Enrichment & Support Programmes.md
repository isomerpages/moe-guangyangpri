<h4><strong>Learning Support Programme (LSP)</strong></h4>
<p>Learning Support Programme focuses on equipping students with the basic
literacy skills that will enable them to then access learning in the regular
classroom.</p>
<h4><strong>School-based Dyslexia Remdiation (SDR)</strong></h4>
<p>School-based Dyslexia Remdiation is a specialised literacy remediation
programme for Primary 3 and Primary 4 students with dyslexia. The programme
aims to enable these students to become strategic decoders and spellers,
flexible in the independent use of different strategies for reading, spelling
and comprehension.</p>
<h4><strong>Reading Remediation Programme (RRP)</strong></h4>
<p>Reading Remediation Programme is an additional literacy support programme
implemented from Primary 3 to Primary 5 to support students with reading
difficulties who do&nbsp;not&nbsp;have dyslexia. The programme will&nbsp;help
students level up their literacy skills so they can cope with the demands
of the mainstream curriculum.&nbsp;

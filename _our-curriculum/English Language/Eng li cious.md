<p><strong>Eng-li-cious: Character Dress-Up Day, Spelling Bee</strong>
</p>
<p>Eng-li-cious, Towsnvilleâ€™s English Week, promotes a love for English Language.
During the event, students get to strengthen their command of the English
language through engaging activities and games.</p>
<p>Highlights of the events include language games such as Spelling Bees,
Word Scramble Challenges, and Tongue Twisters which make learning English
enjoyable.</p>
<p><strong><u>Spelling Bee</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The annual Spelling Bee encourages students to expand their vocabulary
and sharpen their spelling skills. It combines fun and friendly competition,
motivating students to enhance their language abilities in an engaging
way.</p>
<p><strong><u>Character Dress-Up Day</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Character Dress-Up Day also happens during Eng-li-cious. Students get
to dress up as their favourite characters from books, movies, or games,
bringing those characters to life. This day adds lots of fun, vibrancy
and creativity to the school environment. As students dress up as the different
characters related to the theme, they get a chance to share their interests
with their friends and learn from one another.</p>

A **Confident Person** is resilient, knows what is right and wrong and is discerning in his choices.

A **Self-Directed Learner** takes the initiative and responsibility to pursue his own learning.

An **Active Contributor** is a team player who takes initiative, calculated risks and strives for excellence.

A **Concerned Citizen** is rooted to Singapore, informed about Singapore as well as the world. He also strives to better the lives of people around him.

The framework is undergirded by our core values – Loyalty, Diligence, Courage, Honesty and Teamwork. ‘Head’, ‘Heart’ and ‘Hands’ will be the focus of our engagement at all levels.

In engaging the ‘Head’, pupils will be guided to think and reflect on real-life issues and acquire skills, knowledge and dispositions to brave future challenges through the programmes, lessons and authentic experiences provided by the school.

In engaging the ‘Heart’, platforms will be provided for pupils to appreciate our history and heritage as well as connect emotionally with the Singapore story while developing a global outlook.

In engaging the ‘Hands’, pupils will have the opportunity to give back to society and learn that everyone can play a part in building a better Singapore.

Home-School-Community partnership is important for all aspects of education. Parents have the most enduring influence on their children, hence the school will actively engage parents to reinforce the values taught, both at home and in school.

Through our Values In Action (VIA) programme, the school will encourage pupils to identify and understand community issues, initiate actions to make a difference and improve the lives of others in the community. Through this collaboration with the community, we hope to develop in our pupils a sense of belonging and commitment to serve the community and the nation.

#### Programmes


**Leadership Development Programme**

The GYPS Leadership Development Programme aims to maximise the development of pupil leaders’ leadership skills (interpersonal, organisational, problem-solving) and attributes (integrity, confidence, commitment), to groom leaders who are self-directed learners, confident speakers, active contributors and concerned citizens.

Opportunities are created for every pupil to have the chance to experience success at being a leader in the classroom, hence forming the bedrock of pupil leadership development in GYPS. Pupils who display leadership potential are selected to be involved in the running of school programmes.  Within each CCA, members who display leadership potential are identified and trained to lead and represent the members of the CCA group.  All pupils are further screened and those who exude leadership capabilities are identified to join the Prefectorial Board to be pupil leaders of the school.

#### Living with Values@GYPS

Living with Values Programme represents our whole school approach towards creating an immersive environment whereby pupils are actively encouraged to display the school’s core values through various platforms such as recognition of pupils who have displayed the core values, conducting of lessons infused with values, story-telling sessions by pupil leaders and sharing of value quotes with pupils.

#### National Education and Social Studies (NE and SS)

The National Education (NE) and Social Studies (SS) framework follows the outlook of our Singapore MRT track. It outlines the programmes and events carried out for the school to achieve the same desired outcomes of Character and Citizenship Education.

The 3 big circles show the level of involvement of each programme that is conducted with pupils at the core.

The different colours indicate the different approaches that the school undertakes such as **Experience**, **Engage**, **Equip** and **Empower**.

The dotted lines indicate the various departments helming the National Education events.

The stations indicate the different programmes that the school provides for the pupils and teachers in order to achieve its objectives to engage pupils’ ‘Head’, ‘Heart’ and ‘Hands’ in each journey.

**The National Education (NE) Messages**

1\. Singapore is our homeland; this is where we belong.  _(We treasure our heritage and take pride in shaping our own unique way of life.)_  
2\. We must preserve racial and religious harmony. _(We value our diversity and are determined to stay a united people.)_  
3\. We must uphold meritocracy and incorruptibility. _(We provide opportunities for all, according to their ability and effort.)_  
4\. No one owes Singapore a living. _(We find our own way to survive and prosper, turning challenge into opportunity.)_  
5\. We must ourselves defend Singapore. _(We are proud to defend Singapore ourselves, no one else is responsible for our security and well-being.)_  
6\. We have confidence in our future. _(United, determined and well-prepared, we have what it takes to build a bright future for ourselves, and to progress together as one nation.)_

**NE Ambassador Programme**

The NE Ambassador Programme aims to provide a hands-on and minds-on experience for pupils to understand the Singapore story. They learn to share this knowledge with friends and peers turning them into both confident speakers and active contributors. The 3-part programme is introduced to P4 pupils and they will be awarded badges, Bronze, Silver and Gold, at the end of the programme.

<h1 style="color:red;font-size:30px">Character &amp; Citizenship Education (CCE)</h1>

<p style="font-size:20px"><strong>Vision</strong></p>
At Townsville Primary, we believe that values are both caught and taught. The Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) department puts in place structures, processes and programmes to inculcate and build competencies in our students so that they become persons of good character and useful citizens of Singapore.

The total CCE experience includes the academic programmes, CCA, CCE lessons, discipline, practices and student leadership and all other activities that mould a Townsvillite into a person with values and strength of character.

<p style="font-size:20px"><strong>Teaching Approach</strong></p>
The Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Department supports the school mission: A Vibrant School, Leaders of Character and Learners for Life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Our primary focus is to guide our students to learn to be responsible to self, family and community, and to understand their roles in shaping their future and the future of our nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Hence, all our CCE Programmes in TVPS are anchored on building positive self, positive relationships and positive experience for our students.

To ensure a holistic approach to CCE, we have unpacked what we do under the 3 pillars of: **Student Development, Student Leadership, Student Well-Being.**

<p style="font-size:20px"><strong>Key Programmes</strong></p>
The CCE department operates through four main wings:

1\. <b>Character Development</b>

2\. **National Education (NE)**

To instill in students a sense of identity, cultivate the instinct for survival as a nation and confidence in our nation’s future. National Education also emphasises on cultivating a sense of belonging and emotional rootedness to Singapore.

The 4 NE events, Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day, are commemorated by customising NE-focused lessons that are integrated into the Social Studies and CCE lessons. In addition, National Education is pervasively implemented through cohort-based learning journeys.

3\. **Student Leadership Development**&nbsp;

In Townsville Primary, it is our belief that every student can be developed as a leader and every student should be developed as a leader. The Student Leadership committee aims to develop students’ leadership potential, dispositions and values through the LiT (Leaders In Townsville) programme.

<h3>Vision</h3>

A resilient and responsible Townsvillite; a compassionate and active member of the community.<hr><br>

<strong>Teaching Approach</strong>

The CCE curriculum is based on the three big ideas of Identity, Relationships and Choices. It involves the teaching and learning of core values and social-emotional competencies with a focus on developing a sense of purpose in our students.


These fundamentals are taught and applied in the six curriculum content areas of CCE:

1.  National Education
    
2.  Sexuality Education
    
3.  Mental Health
    
4.  Education and Career Guidance
    
5.  Cyber Wellness
    
6.  Family Education
    

<br>&nbsp;

At Townsville, CCE is an ongoing, lifelong journey that unfolds through diverse experiences. Teachers use the SEE approach to craft and support these experiences to facilitate effective learning and attain the CCE's learning outcomes. These experiences are carefully tailored to suit the needs and interests of our students, optimizing their relevance through genuine and meaningful ties to real-world situations.

SEE Approach

1.  Stories and scenarios<br>
    
2.  Explicit skills instruction<br>
    
3.  Experiential learning<br>
    

<br>

Through the SEE approach, students learn to recognise and clarify their values through the process of perspective taking and reflections. Students will be equipped with important social and emotional skills to assist them in navigating various life circumstances and guide them in making responsible decisions. Most importantly, students will undergo a cycle of participating, reflecting, thinking, and acting to internalise their learning experiences.

Key Programmes

There are several learning platforms where CCE is enacted with intentionality. These include CCE lessons during curriculum time, planned student development learning experiences beyond the classroom, teachable moments during other subject lessons and learning opportunities beyond school.<br>

1.  CCE Lessons
    

A dedicated curriculum time for the explicit teaching and learning of values and social-emotional competencies, as well as engaging and building relationships with our students:

● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CCE (FTGP)<br>

● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CCE (MTL)<br>

● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PAL (P1 and P2)<br>

&nbsp;

2.  Student Development Experiences (SDEs)
    

SDEs are programmes and activities that contribute towards the holistic development of our students in physical, aesthetic, intellectual, moral, and social domains:

● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Co-Curricular Activities;<br>

● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cohort Learning Journeys;<br>

● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Education and Career Guidance Experiences;<br>

● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; National Education;<br>

● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Outdoor Adventure Learning Cohort Camps;<br>

● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Student Leadership Development Programmes; and<br>

● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Values in Action<br>













3.  School-based Initiatives
    

At Townsville, students also undergo uniquely designed experiences to foster a caring and enabling school environment for learning:

Project Sparkle

Under the supervision of Eco Student Leaders, students develop a sense of responsibility and care for their environment through daily cleaning and adopting sustainable practices in school. At the end of each term, a thorough wipe down and clean-up of the classrooms are done to ensure the class is ready for the following term.



NE Assembly Programmes

Through NE Commemorative Days such as Total Defence Day and National Day, students learn about Singapore’s important milestones and how they can play their part to keep Singapore a diverse, unified, and resilient country. Mass assembly programmes serve as platforms to educate and remind students on the different national values required to ensure Singapore’s peace and stability.

Weekly SIR &amp; KIR Programme

The Start-It-Right (SIR) and Keep-It-Right (KIR) are structured in students’ weekly timetables where the school’s IDARE2 values and Student’s Creed are taught explicitly. Through case studies, discussion and reflections, students are guided through the process of responsible decision making that is anchored on the values and expected behaviours.



Positive Teacher - Student Relationships

During the weekly Form Teacher (FT) interaction sessions, FTs engage students individually to check in on their well-being. These sessions also serve as a safe and conducive channel for students to share their challenges and concerns with their teachers, and for teachers to keep a lookout for potential issues amongst our students.

4.  Other Subjects
    

Besides linking CCE learning outcomes to content knowledge in other subject areas, the learning of values and social-emotional competencies can also occur through teachable moments.

5.  Personal Applications
    

Students are taught to reflect on their character growth as a lifelong process to develop the habit of self-reflection and gratitude. CCE provides the knowledge and skills to help our students make sense of their life experiences and the language to express their learning and development.

<a href="#1">KEY PROGRAMMES</a> | <a href="#2">DEPARTMENTAL HIGHLIGHTS</a>

### Department Goals
To nurture a vibrant community and maximise the potential of Science learners.

### Approach
Science is formally introduced in GYPS in Primary 3 as per the MOE Primary Science Syllabus. Through the implementation of this syllabus, the Science Department aims to:

* equip pupils with Science knowledge and skills and imbue them with attitudes and ethics to be young scientists;
* raise competency of Science teachers so as to nurture young scientists;
*  maintain strong collaborative culture with key stakeholders and the community;
*  take collaborative action towards environmental responsibility.

### Programmes
Programmes for the Science Department are based on MOE’s Primary Science Syllabus

### MOE Primary Science Syllabus
The Primary Science Syllabus is a foundation for scientific studies at higher levels.

It aims to:

* provide pupils with experiences which build on their interest in and stimulate their curiosity about their environment;
* provide pupils with basic scientific terms and concepts to help them understand themselves and the world around them;
* provide pupils with opportunities to develop skills, habits of mind and attitudes necessary for scientific inquiry;
* prepare pupils towards using scientific knowledge and methods in making personal decisions;
* help pupils appreciate how Science influences people and the environment.

The syllabus has also taken into consideration the desired outcomes of education for our primary pupils as well as the national education emphasis.  This syllabus is based on the Science Curriculum Framework and emphasizes the need for a balance between the acquisition of Science knowledge, process and attitudes.

In addition where the topics lend themselves, the technological applications, social implications and the value aspects of Science are also considered.  It also emphasises the broad coverage of fundamental concepts in the natural and physical world.

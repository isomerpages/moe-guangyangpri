<a id="1"></a>

### Department Goals
To nurture a vibrant community and maximise the potential of Science learners.

### Approach
Science is formally introduced in GYPS in Primary 3 as per the MOE Primary Science Syllabus. Through the implementation of this syllabus, the Science Department aims to:

* equip pupils with Science knowledge and skills and imbue them with attitudes and ethics to be young scientists;
* raise competency of Science teachers so as to nurture young scientists;
*  maintain strong collaborative culture with key stakeholders and the community;
*  take collaborative action towards environmental responsibility.

### Programmes
Programmes for the Science Department are based on MOE’s Primary Science Syllabus

### MOE Primary Science Syllabus
The Primary Science Syllabus is a foundation for scientific studies at higher levels.

It aims to:

* provide pupils with experiences which build on their interest in and stimulate their curiosity about their environment;
* provide pupils with basic scientific terms and concepts to help them understand themselves and the world around them;
* provide pupils with opportunities to develop skills, habits of mind and attitudes necessary for scientific inquiry;
* prepare pupils towards using scientific knowledge and methods in making personal decisions;
* help pupils appreciate how Science influences people and the environment.

The syllabus has also taken into consideration the desired outcomes of education for our primary pupils as well as the national education emphasis.  This syllabus is based on the Science Curriculum Framework and emphasizes the need for a balance between the acquisition of Science knowledge, process and attitudes.

In addition where the topics lend themselves, the technological applications, social implications and the value aspects of Science are also considered.  It also emphasises the broad coverage of fundamental concepts in the natural and physical world.

#### 2018 GYPS Science Curriculum Implementation Overview

The MOE Primary Science curriculum is organised into two teaching blocks, the Lower Block (for Primary 3 and 4) and the Upper Block (for Primary 5 and 6).  This central curriculum is organised for implementation in Guangyang Primary School as follows:

Upper Block (Primary 3 and 4)

### GYPS Learning Day

Pupils engage in discovering new Science knowledge and apply what has been taught in an authentic setting. Components of the GYPS Learning Day include Mathematics, Environment Education, National Education and Collaborative Learning.

#### Primary 1 : Jacob Ballas Children’s Garden

P1 Courage, Diligence, Honesty and Loyalty classes with their teachers went to this magical and educational garden on 30 May 2019.  Pupils completed a set of multi-disciplinary activity sheets as they explored the garden, using the information panels to work out the answers and drawing leaves.

At the same time, they enjoyed the scenery, experienced walking on a zig-zag walkway, crossed a suspension bridge and jumped on a mini-trampoline as well as trying other activities.

#### Primary 2 : Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park

This learning activity exposes and introduces Primary 2 pupils to the skills of a scientist. The activity, conducted as a Programme for Active Learning (PAL), develops observation skills and allows pupils to apply what they have learnt through the PAL Outdoor Education module.

#### Primary 3 : Botanical Gardens

The learning of Science comes alive for our Primary 3 pupils as they are introduced to the beauty and diversity of nature at the Botanical Gardens. Pupils get to appreciate the local flora and fauna up close and personal.

#### Primary 4 : Gardens by the Bay

The learning journey for our Primary 4 pupils combines authentic learning with ICT through the use of a mobile application designed and created by GYPS teachers.

The interactive mobile learning trail supports self-directed learning (SDL) and collaborative learning (COL) outside the classroom. Through the use of the mobile app, learning Science becomes more fun and engaging for pupils.

#### Primary 5 : Singapore Sports Hub

Science concepts and their applications can be found everywhere. What better place to learn and discover more about Science than the newly constructed Singapore Sports Hub with its beautiful surroundings. National Education, with a focus on Singapore’s sporting heroes, is featured in this learning activity.

#### Primary 6 : Singapore Zoological Gardens

The Singapore Zoological Gardens provides numerous opportunities for pupils to study nature and wildlife in closer detail.  In this learning journey, pupils continue to sharpen their Science inquiry skills and build on their Science knowledge.  Here, they focus on applying Science knowledge learnt from Primary 3 through Primary 6 with special attention paid to interactions within the environment.

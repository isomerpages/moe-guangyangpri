<p></p><center><h4>We Dare</h4>
We begin, here in Townsville,<br>
to learn and to share.<br>
To forge lasting friendships,<br>
to grow in love and care.

We will learn our values<br>
so that we can be the light,<br>
Shining bright for all to see!

We will dare to dream, to be the best,<br>
to set our aspirations free.<br>
We will dare to lead, with heads held high,<br>
to uphold integrity.

We will strive to fly,<br>
our colours high above.

Through the years,<br>
we will grow,<br>
in strength and confidence.<br>
Our values at the heart<br>
of all we do.

We will dare to dream, to be the best,<br>
to set our aspirations free.<br>
We will dare to lead, with heads held high,<br>
to uphold integrity.
   
We will strive to fly,<br>
our colours high above.<br>
â€˜Cause we dare to dream,<br>
and we dare to achieve.
   
We dare because<br>
we believe.<br>

Guangyang Primary School (光洋小学), originally named Kong Yiong School, was started by a group of Chinese education enthusiasts on 25 February 1918, offering Chinese as the first language. It was first located next to the Serangoon Post Office. It was moved several times until it finally settled at 993B Yio Chu Kang Road in 1930 where it remained until November 1992.

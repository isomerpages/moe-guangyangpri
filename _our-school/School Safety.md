**Safe Route to Guangyang Primary School**

Pupils who walk from Bishan MRT or Bus Interchange to school tend to walk along Bishan Street 12 and cross the road at the exit and entrance of the carpark at Blk 112 where there is no designated pedestrian crossing. Pupils are advised to take the safe route to school as follows:

*   Cross the road at the junction of Bishan Street 13 and Bishan Street 11.
*   Next, cross the traffic light at the Singapore Scout Association.
*   Thereafter, walk to the traffic light junction near the bus stop outside the school and use the crossing there to reach school.

**Safe Route to Guangyang Primary School**

Pupils who walk from Bishan MRT or Bus Interchange to school tend to walk along Bishan Street 12 and cross the road at the exit and entrance of the carpark at Blk 112 where there is no designated pedestrian crossing. Pupils are advised to take the safe route to school as follows:

*   Cross the road at the junction of Bishan Street 13 and Bishan Street 11.
*   Next, cross the traffic light at the Singapore Scout Association.
*   Thereafter, walk to the traffic light junction near the bus stop outside the school and use the crossing there to reach school.

**Vehicular Safety**

We seek your patience and understanding to observe the traffic regulations and to exercise consideration for others. This is to ensure the safety and well-being of our pupils as well as members of the community. Please take note of the following if you are driving your children to school:

*   Slow down your driving speed to 40 kph when approaching the school vicinity along Bishan Street 12
*   Reduce vehicle speed limit to 10 kph when driving within the school compound and observe proper lane discipline at all times
*   Ensure that your child alight from the car on the side nearest to the designated drop-off point at the foyer
*   Train your child to alight from the car without your assistance

**Emergency Evacuation Drills**

*   Emergency evacuation drills are held at regular intervals throughout the school year. An emergency evacuation plan is placed in all classrooms and special rooms. Teachers take time to go through the emergency route and plan with the pupils at the start and the middle of the school year.

**Safety and Security in the School Premises (Visitors)**

*   All visitors are to report to the Security Post located at the main gate before coming into the school. All visitors are required to put on the visitor’s pass issued by the security guards. This will enable us to quickly identify unauthorised persons within the school premises. The teaching blocks (Block B and Block C) are strictly out of bounds to all visitors.
*   The school would like to appeal to all parents not to remain in the school premises unless when it is necessary.

**Security in School (Pupils)**

*   All pupils are to refrain from bringing valuable items and large sums of money to school.
*   Do not leave the classroom or school without the teacher’s permission.

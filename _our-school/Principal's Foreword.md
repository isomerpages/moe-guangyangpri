<h4 style="text-align:center">Townsville Primary School (光洋小学)
<br>A Vibrant School • Leaders of Character • Learner for Life</h4>

As we step into this new year, brimming with possibilities and aspirations, I am filled with excitement and gratitude for the journey ahead with the Townsville Primary School (TVPS) community. Together, we will embark on a purposeful pursuit of excellence, growth and meaningful connections for every child entrusted to our care.

At TVPS, our **vision** inspires us to be _A Vibrant School with Leaders of Character, Learners for Life_. This reflects our commitment to developing confident, compassionate individuals who are not only prepared for the challenges of the future but are also driven to shape it. Guided by our **mission**—_Ignite Learning, Maximise Potential, Nurture the Child_— we ignite curiosity, nurture strengths and cultivate character to help our students realise their dreams.

In 2025, we renew our commitment to cultivating a vibrant environment where each child can thrive academically, socially and emotionally. Through innovative programmes, strong partnerships with parents, and the dedication of our educators, we aim to unleash the boundless potential within every student, empowering them to become purposeful leaders and resilient lifelong learners.

Let us come together to make this year an extraordinary chapter in the lives of our children. May 2025 be a year of breakthroughs, boundless opportunities, and profound moments of growth for our students and for the entire Townsville community.

Here’s to a year where we dream big and create a brighter future – together.

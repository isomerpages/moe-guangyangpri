Townsville Primary School (光洋小学)
Br A Vibrant School • Leaders of Character • Learner for Life

It is my utmost pleasure to extend a warm greeting to our vibrant school community, where we strive to mould young minds into leaders of character and learners for life. Our vision echoes a commitment to creating an environment where each individual shines brightly in their unique way.

At Townsville Primary School, our mission is succinct yet profound: to ignite learning, maximise potential, and nurture the child. These pillars stand as the cornerstone of our educational journey, guiding us toward academic excellence while fostering holistic development.

Embedded within our ethos are the values that define us — encapsulated in iDARE2. Integrity forms the bedrock of our actions, guiding us to consistently do what is right. Diligence empowers us to persevere, even in the face of adversity, ensuring that our best efforts are consistently put forth. Aspiration fuels our desire to explore, encouraging us to take charge of our learning and personal growth. Respect and Empathy are the keystones of our interactions, nurturing a culture of inclusivity, kindness and understanding. And through a pursuit of Excellence, we consistently challenge ourselves to reach higher, never settling for mediocrity.

Together, as a community driven by these values, we not only prepare our students for academic success but also equip them to thrive in a diverse and ever-evolving world. Our commitment remains steadfast in providing a nurturing environment that fosters intellectual curiosity, emotional intelligence and social responsibility.

I am immensely proud of our students, staff and parents who collectively contribute to the vibrant tapestry that is Townsville Primary School. As we embark on this journey together, let us continue to uphold these values and work collaboratively towards a future where each individual realises their fullest potential.

****Our School Vision:
A Vibrant School • Leaders of Character • Learners for Life**

It is with great excitement and enthusiasm that we embark the year 2023. The merger of Townsville Primary School and Guangyang Primary School has presented us with many possibilities to create an exciting future ahead of us. Building on the strengths of both schools, we remain steadfast to ensure that this school is an institution of vibrant learning, a place where children discover their innate talents and abilities, broaden their horizons and excel to their personal best.

Guided by our compelling vision, this school provides our students a balanced and well-rounded education. We develop every Townsvillite to their potential, and nurture them into good citizens who take lead to make a difference. We provide platforms and create varied opportunities to ignite the passion and joy of learning in students who take actions to live their passion every day and for the future. You will get to see and feel the vibrancy and heartbeat of our school as you explore our school website.

It takes a village to raise a child. We welcome and partner parents and the community to provide the best educational experiences for our children. We want to encourage each and every one to journey with us as we give our children the most enriching and meaningful schooling experience in Townsville Primary School.
